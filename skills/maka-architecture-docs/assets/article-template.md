# <Reader-oriented title>

> In one paragraph: what question this article answers, the conclusion, and why it matters.

## Why this matters

Describe the engineering or reader problem. Define the scope and relevant exclusions.

## Mental model

Give the simplest correct intuition. Define central terms before relying on them.

## A concrete scenario

Introduce one representative example that can continue through the article.

## How it works

Explain the mechanism, sequence, data, and component responsibilities. Add only diagrams that answer a specific question.

## State and invariants

Describe lifecycle, durable and ephemeral state, valid transitions, ownership, ordering, and conditions that must remain true.

## Boundaries

State what this mechanism owns, what it delegates, and what it explicitly does not guarantee.

## Failure and recovery

Cover timeouts, interruption, cancellation, retry, partial success, recovery, and irrecoverable failure as applicable.

## Decisions and trade-offs

Explain the chosen design, credible alternatives, benefits, costs, and revisit conditions.

## Code and operational map

Point to stable modules, types, interfaces, schemas, tests, logs, traces, and metrics appropriate to the promised reading depth.

## Known limitations and future direction

Keep Current, Planned, and Exploratory claims visibly separate.

## Further reading

Link related architecture documents, ADRs, API specifications, and code-owned references.
