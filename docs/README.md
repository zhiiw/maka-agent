# Maka documentation

This page is the authority map for Maka documentation. Code and contract tests remain the final authority when documentation disagrees with the implementation.

## Where information belongs

- Root and package READMEs describe stable product entry points, public seams, and local ownership.
- `docs/` contains current cross-cutting architecture, security, product, and validation contracts.
- GitHub issues and pull requests contain implementation plans, migration progress, and time-sensitive TODOs.
- `docs/archive/` preserves completed plans and superseded material for historical context. Archived documents are not current implementation guidance.

## Start here

- [Desktop architecture](../apps/desktop/README.md)
- [Renderer architecture](../apps/desktop/src/renderer/README.md)

- [Runtime package](../packages/runtime/README.md)
- [Computer Use package](../packages/computer-use/README.md)

## Maintenance

- Add stable cross-cutting documentation to the closest section above.
- Put local architecture beside the code and link it from **Start here**.
- Keep progress and TODOs in issues or pull requests instead of copying them into stable documents.
- Move completed plans to `docs/archive/`; remove a document only after its unique references are updated or no longer needed.
- Prefer updating an existing authority over adding a parallel document.
- Keep PR follow-up records, incident investigations, and run logs in the pull request or `docs/archive/`, not as new current contracts. `notes/` and `docs/local/` are workspace-local scratch and stay untracked.
- Do not commit PR or issue screenshots under `docs/`. Attach temporary visual evidence on the GitHub thread; product hero/marketing images live under `.github/assets/`.
