// oauth-login-flow-guard.ts's createOneShotActionGuard for components that
// hold several independent action latches at once (the connection detail
// sheet's six mutually excluding actions, the memory / workspace-instructions
// controllers' per-row action keys). Kept React-free so its behavior is
// unit-testable without a DOM (see action-guard.test.ts) and so the desktop
// test runner can import it without pulling React into its program.
//
// The check stays synchronous — a second concurrent action is rejected before
// React can re-render the disabled button, never subject to render batching.
