/**
 * A settled value that becomes a form only when the user asks it to.
 *
 * The shape is Astryx's own — the `settings-sidebar` template's ExpandableRow
 * (`@astryxdesign/cli/templates/pages/settings-sidebar/page.tsx:140-193`): a
 * row reports its label and current value with one affordance to change it,
 * and swaps in place for the editor plus Save / Cancel. At most one row in a
 * group is open at a time, which is the caller's `expandedRow` state.
 *
 * The shape is copied; the template's implementation is not, because it has
 * three problems this component exists to not have:
 *
 * 1. The template's trigger is `<a href="#">` with `preventDefault`. That
 *    announces itself as a link, ignores Space, and points nowhere. Opening a
 *    form is a button.
 *
 * 2. The template has no focus management at all. Expanding moves focus into
 *    the editor here, and Save / Cancel return it to the trigger the user came
 *    from — otherwise collapsing drops focus to the top of the document and a
 *    keyboard user loses their place in the list.
 *
 * 3. The template's Cancel only closes; its fields edit live, so there is
 *    nothing to discard. Ours is a real discard: the caller reverts its draft
 *    in `onCancel`, which is what makes Cancel mean anything.
 *
 * Built on `SettingsRow` rather than a bare HStack so the collapsed row keeps
 * the Item vocabulary the rest of the surface uses — the `settingsRowEnd`
 * width ceiling and the container queries in rows.css apply here too. The
 * expanded editor sits in a `SettingsField`, the same full-width block a
 * permanently-open input would use.
