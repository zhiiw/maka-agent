/**
 * Prefetch the onboarding snapshot BEFORE mounting React. The preload
 * skeleton (index.html) stays on screen while this resolves, so the first
 * React commit already has sessions + connections and paints the real
 * chat surface directly — no intermediate loading card, no layout jump
 * (the "配置页闪了一下" startup flash).
 *
 * Fail-open: one quick retry (the IPC handler may not be registered in
 * the first milliseconds), then a hard timeout so a wedged main process
 * can never block the renderer from mounting. On timeout/failure React
 * mounts with `null` and the classic in-app loading path takes over.
