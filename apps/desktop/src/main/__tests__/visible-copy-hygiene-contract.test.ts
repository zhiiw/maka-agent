/**
 * Static-analysis contract test for visible-copy hygiene
 * (PR-SIDEBAR-IA-0 Phase 3 P0 fixup v2, kenji msg `08be08d8`).
 *
 * Background:
 *   WAWQAQ noticed `建文` showing up in his real chat surface
 *   (msg `1886c41b`). Tracing it back: the visual-smoke fixture
 *   seeded `personalization.displayName = '建文'` for screenshot
 *   determinism, but that placeholder name has no product
 *   meaning — a user opening a demo workspace (or anyone
 *   reviewing a baseline screenshot) sees a stranger's name as
 *   the "user" label.
 *
 *   Kenji also called out `WELCOME TO MAKA` (all-caps English
 *   eyebrow in `NeedsConnectionHero`) as inconsistent with the
 *   rest of the Chinese-first surface (msg `08be08d8` #4).
 *
 * This file is a grep-style gate that fails if either string
 * reappears in renderer/UI source. The runtime fix landed
 * separately (fixture displayName → '', eyebrow → '欢迎使用 Maka').
 *
 * Add new entries to `FORBIDDEN_VISIBLE_COPY` when a reviewer
 * calls out additional copy drift that should never reappear.

 * The same string is passed through three stripping passes:
 *   1. Block comments `/* ... *\/` (non-greedy, including newlines).

 *   3. Line comments `// ...\n` (per-line tail).

 * scans have no such legitimate sequences in code (only inside
 * source comments we're already stripping), so the bias is safe.
