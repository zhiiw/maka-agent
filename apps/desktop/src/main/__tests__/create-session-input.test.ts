/**
 * #1433: `quickChat:start` was a second session-creation IPC whose only
 * distinct job was turning a product mode into session fields. The IPC is
 * gone; this is the part that survived, and the gates it used to carry are
 * pinned here as behavior rather than as regexes over the handler's source.
 *
 * What a product mode expands into — its boundary, name and labels — belongs
 * to the Runtime Host, which receives `mode` verbatim and owns the expansion.
 * This module only decides what reaches the wire, so that is all it pins.
