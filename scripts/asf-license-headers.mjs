/**
 * ASF source-header audit.
 *
 * The audit asserts two properties of the tree it is pointed at, and nothing
 * else:
 *
 *   1. Every entry is classified exactly once — covered, excluded with a
 *      recorded reason, or an audit failure. Nothing is dropped from the tree
 *      under audit; the enumeration only decides which tree that is.
 *   2. In every covered file the ASF license text occurs exactly once, and
 *      that occurrence is the canonical rendering at the top of the file.
 *
 * Both are properties of the artifact, stated without reference to what
 * `write` produces. That separation is the point: an audit defined as "starts
 * with the bytes this module emits" can only confirm its own writer, and will
 * accept a second header stacked on top of a first one it failed to recognize.
 *
 * So detection is deliberately loose and acceptance deliberately strict.
 * `countLicenseText` finds the license text through any comment syntax,
 * indentation, or line wrapping; only the exact canonical rendering is
 * accepted. `write` is correspondingly dumb — it inserts a header where there
 * is none and refuses every other state, because every other state is a
 * decision a person has to make.
 *
 * See `.github/ASF_SOURCE_HEADERS.md` for the policy this file implements.
