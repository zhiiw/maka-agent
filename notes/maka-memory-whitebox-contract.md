# Maka memory — white-box contract anchor (2026-05-29)

Owner: yuejing. Anchor for the team's evolving local-memory feature
once xuan's transparent-file MVP landed at `c06e13f`. Aligned to:
- `packages/core/src/local-memory.ts` (xuan)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/local-memory-service.ts` (xuan)
- Settings → 记忆 UI (xuan)
- Hermes deep-dive note `notes/hermes-deep-dive-2026-05-29.md` §3.5
- PilotDeck deep-dive note `notes/pilotdeck-deep-dive-2026-05-29.md` §2.2
- kenji `19b0996f` boundary: local transparent file MUST NOT become
  implicit durable memory; agent-read default-off.

This note is a contract anchor, not a PR. It freezes the field names
+ status semantics so V0.2 / V0.3 PRs can extend predictably without
breaking V0.1 disk format. If reality changes, edit here first.

## V0.1 — what xuan shipped (`c06e13f`)

### Settings shape (live)

```ts
interface LocalMemorySettings {
  enabled: boolean;          // file feature on/off (default ON)
  agentReadEnabled: boolean; // agent may consume in system prompt
                             // (default OFF)
}
```

Two switches were the right scope:

- `enabled` ON + `agentReadEnabled` OFF — the file lives on disk,
  user can edit, agent gets NOTHING.
- `enabled` ON + `agentReadEnabled` ON — file appears in system
  prompt as a dedicated section. Incognito context fails closed.
- `enabled` OFF — file untouched on disk; reads return disabled
  state.

### File location + permissions

- Directory mode `0700`, file mode `0600`.
- Lives under the workspace directory.
- `LOCAL_MEMORY_MAX_BYTES = 128 KB` enforced at parse time.

### Disk format (live)

Each entry is a Markdown H2 section followed by an HTML-comment
metadata line:

```markdown
# Maka Memory

## <title or slug>
<!-- maka-memory: id=<id> origin=manual createdAt=<unix-ms> -->
<content lines>

## <next title>
<!-- maka-memory: id=<id2> origin=manual createdAt=<unix-ms> -->
...
```

Parser is fail-open: an entry with a malformed comment still
renders its content. The HTML-comment metadata is intentionally
hidden from human readers in most Markdown viewers.

### Parse output (live)

```ts
interface LocalMemoryEntryPreview {
  id: string;
  origin: 'manual' | 'unknown';
  title: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt?: number;
}

interface LocalMemoryState {
  path: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  agentReadEnabled: boolean;
  status: 'ok' | 'disabled' | 'safe_mode' | 'incognito_blocked' | 'error';
  content: string;
  entryCount: number;
  latestEntry?: LocalMemoryEntryPreview;
  reason?: string;
}
```

Status enum invariants:
- `disabled` — `settings.enabled === false`. UI shows the toggle.
- `incognito_blocked` — workspace privacy context active. Even when
  enabled, no read happens.
- `safe_mode` — file is over `LOCAL_MEMORY_MAX_BYTES`. Returns
  empty entry list with a banner; user can still open + edit.
- `error` — IO error. Generalized copy in `reason`.
- `ok` — normal read.

## V0.2 — extensions on top of the V0.1 disk format

V0.2 extends the metadata comment with optional fields. **Parser
MUST stay fail-open for unknown fields** so V0.1 readers never
crash on a V0.2-written file.

```html
<!-- maka-memory: id=<id> origin=<origin> createdAt=<ms> updatedAt=<ms> status=<status> tags=<csv> decayTtlMs=<ms> -->
```

### Origin (V0.2)

```ts
type MemoryOrigin = 'manual' | 'extracted' | 'imported' | 'unknown';
```

- `manual` — user typed it. V0.1 only writes this.
- `extracted` — written by a future `extract_memory` agent tool.
  That tool MUST be `permissionRequired: true` with its own user
  approval prompt, gated on `agentReadEnabled` (you cannot
  extract what you said the agent cannot read), gated on
  `!incognitoActive`.
- `imported` — bulk-imported (Honcho / mem0 / supermemory export
  / OpenAI ChatGPT memory JSON / etc.).

### Status (V0.2)

```ts
type MemoryEntryStatus = 'active' | 'archived';
```

- `active` — surfaces in agent prompt + UI list.
- `archived` — stays in the file (user can re-activate) but does
  not enter the prompt. UI lists archived entries in a separate
  pane.

`decayTtlMs` is the auto-archive timer: when `now > createdAt +
decayTtlMs`, the next parse promotes the entry to `archived`. The
file is rewritten with `status=archived` in-line — a write the
user can see, not a hidden background mutation.

### Tags (V0.2)

`tags=foo,bar` — string CSV. Used for filtering in the UI and
optional system-prompt section grouping.

### Stable id (V0.2)

Currently V0.1 uses `manual-<unix-ms>`. V0.2 switches new entries
to `sha256(content + createdAt).slice(0, 16)` so id is stable
across edits of the title. Old `manual-*` ids remain valid; the
parser accepts both.

### Settings additions (V0.2)

```ts
interface LocalMemorySettings {
  enabled: boolean;
  agentReadEnabled: boolean;
  // V0.2:
  defaultDecayDays?: number;     // entries created without an
                                 // explicit decay inherit this
  extractToolEnabled?: boolean;  // gates the extract_memory tool
                                 // registration; default false
}
```

`extractToolEnabled` is the third switch that makes the
`extract_memory` agent tool surface. It is OFF by default and
disabled when `agentReadEnabled` is OFF (you cannot extract
memory the agent cannot use).

## V0.3 — open questions (NOT contract; revisit when relevant)

These are explicitly OPEN questions. Recording them here so the
next person who picks up the lane knows the field is not
settled.

### Provider abstraction

Hermes ships `plugins/memory/{honcho,mem0,supermemory}`. PilotDeck
has `EdgeClawMemoryProvider`. Alma is built-in `MemoryService` +
sqlite-vec. **Three-way convergence is NOT present** — kenji's
finding `7749c411` #3. Defer abstraction until a real external
backend lands (a paying user wants Honcho or a vector store).

If we adopt:
- `MemoryProvider` interface in `@maka/core/memory`
- Built-in `LocalMarkdownProvider` (today's file)
- Plugin path for `HonchoProvider` etc.

### Vector search

Embedding generation is a separate provider lane (alma's
`__local__` / OpenAI / aihubmix / openrouter / Google selector).
Independent of the memory storage backend. Defer.

### Cross-session recall

V0.1 / V0.2 always returns the whole memory file. V0.3 may
implement retrieval — emit only top-K relevant entries based on
a query. Requires a retrieval algorithm choice; vector vs FTS5
vs LLM-judge. Defer.

### Dream Mode (PilotDeck term)

Idle-window memory consolidation: when the app sits idle for X
minutes, summarize chat sessions into new memory entries. Has
serious privacy implications. Even with `extractToolEnabled` ON
this would be an additional opt-in. Defer.

### Multi-workspace memory

PilotDeck's pitch is per-workspace memory + cross-workspace
aggregation. Maka has workspaces. V0.3 could expose a
`memory.scope: 'workspace' | 'global'` field per entry. Defer.

## Contract test surface (suggested, not shipped)

When V0.2 lands, the following invariants should be enforced by
contract tests:

1. `parseLocalMemoryMarkdown` is fail-open on unknown comment
   fields — never throws, never drops a known entry.
2. `agentReadEnabled === false` ⇒ system prompt NEVER contains
   the memory section, regardless of `enabled`.
3. Workspace privacy context `incognitoActive === true` ⇒
   `LocalMemoryState.status === 'incognito_blocked'` even when
   both switches are ON.
4. `extract_memory` agent tool registration is gated on
   `extractToolEnabled === true && agentReadEnabled === true`.
5. The token-boundary contract is preserved: memory content
   crosses the renderer↔main IPC; raw tokens / API keys never
   leak into a memory entry via redactSecrets on the write path.
