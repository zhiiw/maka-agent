/**
 * Attention layer for long-running turns, permission prompts, and errors.
 *
 * Two signals, driven from the runner's turn lifecycle:
 *  - the terminal title carries a state marker (busy / attention-needed / idle),
 *    so a glance at the tab tells you what the session is doing; and
 *  - a terminal BEL rings when something wants the user *while the terminal is
 *    not focused*, so a turn finishing or a prompt appearing in a background tab
 *    is not missed.
 *
 * Focus is tracked out of band: the runner enables DEC private mode 1004 and
 * feeds `focusChanged` from the `\x1b[I` / `\x1b[O` reports. Terminals that do
 * not support 1004 never report a blur, so `focused` stays true and no BEL ever
 * fires — the title markers still work everywhere, but the ring is suppressed
 * rather than sounding while the user is watching. That is the conservative
 * degradation: never ring when we cannot confirm the user is away.
