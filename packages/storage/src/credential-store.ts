 * ones AND proper-lockfile — is a TOCTOU race: between judging a lock stale and
 * deleting it, another contender can reclaim it, so the delete drops a live

 * compare-and-steal, so we do not steal at all.
 *
 * The cost: a hard crash (SIGKILL / power loss) mid-write leaves the lock
 * directory behind, and the next writer fails loud until it is removed — an
 * explicit, one-command recovery, never a silent lost update. A clean exit or a
