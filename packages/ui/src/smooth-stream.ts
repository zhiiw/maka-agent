/**
 * PR-UI-RENDER-1 — Smooth streaming hook.
 *
 * The renderer used to bind streaming text directly to `<Markdown>`,
 * so each `text_delta` event triggered an immediate re-render. The
 * visible result was "jumpy" output: chunks landed in clumps,
 * sometimes the whole sentence appeared at once, and the user never
 * saw the calm typewriter cadence other modern chat clients produce.
 *
 * `useSmoothStreamContent` decouples the displayed text from the
 * upstream `rawText`. It:
 *
 *   - Tracks the EMA of arrival characters-per-second (graphemes
 *     per second, more precisely). New deltas feed the EMA; a slow
 *     network does not slow the typewriter floor.
 *   - Advances `displayedCount` once per RAF frame at the smoothed
 *     CPS, clamped to `[minCps, maxCps]`.
 *   - **Grapheme-aware slicing** via `Intl.Segmenter` so emoji
 *     ZWJ-sequences (family, skin-tone, flag) and CRLF stay whole.
 *     Falls back to codepoint slicing (`Array.from`) when the
 *     environment lacks `Intl.Segmenter`. Never slices on raw code
 *     unit indices, which would cut surrogate pairs.
 *   - **Backlog snap**: if displayed lags raw by more than
 *     `maxBacklogGraphemes`, snap to raw. This handles history
 *     hydration (initial mount with non-empty raw) and "the network
 *     dumped 5KB in one chunk" without infinite catch-up.
 *   - **Complete flush budget**: when `streaming` flips to false,
 *     raise the catch-up speed so the remaining tail drains within
 *     `completeFlushBudgetMs` instead of snapping to the final text.
 *   - **Reduced-motion bypass**: callers pass `snap: true` (typically
 *     derived from `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` or the
 *     visual-smoke fixture attribute) to skip all smoothing.
 *   - **Single RAF owner**: one `useEffect` schedules one RAF; its
 *     cleanup cancels any in-flight handle before the next effect
 *     re-runs. No way to have two RAFs writing state concurrently
 *     (review blocker #4 from @kenji).
 *
 * The pure helpers (`segmentGraphemes`, `computeFrameAdvance`,
 * `shouldSnapForBacklog`, `updateEma`, `resolveInitialDisplayedCount`)
 * are exported so they can be unit-tested without a DOM. The React
 * hook is a thin shell over them.

/**
 * PR-UI-C1 review fixup (@kenji msg fbb8f119) — pure trust-boundary
 * gate that callers MUST apply before feeding text to
 * `useSmoothStreamContent`.
 *
 * The smoother typewriters by rendering successive PREFIXES of its
 * input string. If the raw input contains a partially-emitted
 * secret (e.g. mid-delta `Authorization: Bearer sk-secret123`), the
 * smoother would briefly paint each prefix to the DOM — even though
 * the FULL string would later be masked by the downstream Markdown
 * redactor. The prefix `Authorization: Bearer s` doesn't match any
 * secret pattern by itself, so it would leak to the screen for a
 * frame or two.
 *
 * Solution: callers run the raw text through `prepareSmoothStreamText`
 * BEFORE handing it to `useSmoothStreamContent`. The function
 * applies `redactSecrets` on the full input, so the smoother only
 * ever sees already-masked text — every prefix of which is
 * guaranteed secret-free. The downstream `<Markdown>` (or `<pre>`)
 * stays in place as defense in depth.
 *
 * `redactSecrets` is idempotent on already-masked text, so it's
 * safe to apply this helper even when the upstream path already
 * redacted (e.g. ReasoningPanel, where C0's `applyThinkingDelta`
 * already ran `redactSecrets` on each delta).
 *
 * The function is pure and exported so callers can also use it in
 * tests / non-React contexts to verify the trust boundary.
