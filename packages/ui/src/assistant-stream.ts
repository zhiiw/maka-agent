/**
 * PR-UI-Cx (@kenji C1 residual note msg aa2d26a7) — pure
 * trust-boundary helper for the assistant `text_delta` stream the
 * renderer accumulates into `streamingBySession[sessionId]`.
 *
 * Mirrors A3 `tool-output-stream` / C0 `thinking-stream` exactly:
 *   - pure helper `applyAssistantDelta`
 *   - per-delta cap (defensive against a single misbehaving multi-MB
 *     chunk)
 *   - per-session total cap (bounds renderer state for a runaway
 *     stream)
 *   - secondary `redactSecrets` BEFORE state — the renderer cannot
 *     trust upstream to have masked every secret, and a raw
 *     `Authorization: Bearer …` prefix sitting in `streamingBySession`
 *     would expose the secret via React DevTools snapshot, the
 *     "copy message" affordance, and any future serialization that
 *     walks the streaming state.
 *
 * Why "head-keep, mark the tail" instead of "tail-keep, mark the
 * head" for the total cap (different from thinking-stream):
 *
 *   Assistant text is read by the user TOP-DOWN as it streams —
 *   they begin reading the first token immediately and follow the
 *   answer sequentially. Tail-keep would scroll the start of the
 *   answer OFF, which is exactly the wrong shape for "read the
 *   model's reply". Head-keep with a trailing "[…后续已截断]"
 *   marker preserves the visible content the user has been reading
 *   and tells them clearly that more was produced but cut.
 *
 *   Thinking-stream tail-keeps because the user is watching the
 *   CURRENT chain of thought ("what is the model thinking right
 *   now"). Assistant output is the opposite affordance.
 *
 * Per-delta cap stays tail-keep with a head marker — same as
 * thinking — because a single oversize delta is a runtime
 * misbehavior and the user has not been "reading" within that one
 * chunk yet; the chunk is about to be appended atomically.

/**
 * Default caps. Tuned to:
 *   - 4 KB per single delta: matches A3 tool-output's per-chunk
 *     cap and the runtime's `TOOL_OUTPUT_DELTA_MAX_CHARS`. Streaming
 *     models normally emit ≤ a few hundred chars per delta; a single
 *     4KB+ delta is misbehavior and gets tail-kept.
 *   - 256 KB total per session: a generous bound for ONE assistant
 *     turn. A typical model reply runs 200B-30KB; long-form code +
 *     prose can hit ~80KB; 256KB caps a runaway stream while
 *     leaving 99% of legitimate replies untouched. Past this cap,
 *     further deltas are dropped (the buffer freezes with a
 *     trailing marker; the user sees the head of the answer plus
 *     "[…后续已截断]" — not a silently-truncated mess).

 * Apply a single `text_delta` to the prior accumulated assistant
 * text. Pure: no React state, no DOM, no IPC.
 *
 * Pipeline (in order):
 *   1. `redactSecrets(rawDelta)` — per-delta mask. Catches secrets
 *      that arrive entirely within one delta.
 *   2. If the delta alone is over `maxDeltaChars`, tail-keep it
 *      with a head truncation marker. (A single multi-MB delta is
 *      a runtime misbehavior; renderer must not echo it raw into
 *      state. Tail-keep here mirrors thinking-stream — the user
 *      hasn't been reading inside the delta atomically.)
 *   3. Append to `prev`.
 *   4. `redactSecrets(appended)` — **cross-delta** mask. CRITICAL:
 *      streaming naturally splits tokens across deltas (e.g.
 *      `"Authorization: Bearer sk-"` arrives in delta N, then
 *      `"abcdef1234567890"` in delta N+1). Per-delta redaction
 *      alone can't catch a secret spanning the seam. This second
 *      pass over the freshly-appended candidate is the chokepoint
 *      that lets us assert: NO raw secret EVER enters
 *      `streamingBySession` state. @kenji review @msg 3c01e901
 *      Blocker 1 — this MUST run before total-cap + setState.
 *   5. If the safe-appended exceeds `maxTotalChars`, head-keep
 *      the prefix and append a trailing marker. (User reads the
 *      answer from top; we preserve what they've been reading
 *      and tell them the rest was cut.)
 *
 * Short-circuit: once the buffer is at the total cap (ends with
 * the trailing-truncation marker), subsequent deltas are dropped
 * entirely.
 *
 * `redactSecrets` is idempotent on already-masked text, so the
 * double-redaction (per-delta + post-append) is correct.
