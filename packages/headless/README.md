# @maka/headless

The single headless entry point for driving a Maka agent without a UI. Its
evaluation mode can run a **Config × Task** grid, capture each trajectory,
score it with the task's own command, and compare.

```
Config × Task  →  throwaway workspace  →  headless agent run  →  trajectory
                                                                     ↓
                              ResultRecord (JSONL)  ←  verification command
```

## CLI

```sh
maka eval run <spec.json> [--out <dir>]
maka eval compare <results.jsonl>
maka eval task-run run <spec.json> --task <id> --config <id> [--out <dir>]
maka eval task-run inspect <taskRunId> --store <out>/runs [--json]
maka eval task-run export <taskRunId> --store <out>/runs --out <dir> [--include-events]
maka eval task-run resume <taskRunId> --spec <spec.json> --out <dir> [--grant-file <json>]
maka eval task-run retry-failed <results.jsonl|out-dir> --spec <spec.json> --out <dir>
maka eval ahe export <taskRunId...> --store <out>/runs --repo <repo> --out <dir>
maka eval harbor run --instruction <text> --workdir <dir> --out <dir> --isolation harbor-local
```

Try it with the bundled fake-backend demo (no API key needed):

```sh
maka eval run examples/demo.spec.json --out /tmp/maka-headless-demo
```

## Trust posture

`eval` is **untrusted by construction**: the config under test is something you
are *measuring*, possibly weak or adversarial, so it must not reach the host.
Without OS-level isolation the only safe enforcement is to **fail closed by
default**:

- The CLI still wires only the inert **`fake`** backend. A model-backed backend
  in a JSON spec exits non-zero unless the caller uses the programmatic API to
  provide backend wiring.
- Programmatic real-model eval must pass `realBackendIsolation` to
  `runExperiment` plus a `registerBackends` factory. The isolation record is an
  explicit assertion that tool execution is already outside the host credential
  process (for example Harbor / Terminal-Bench or a Docker workspace executor).
- If the caller wants Maka's standard tool surface, use
  `buildIsolatedHeadlessTools(executor)`: it routes `Bash` plus
  `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Glob`/`Grep` through the supplied isolation boundary.
  Executors can implement native file-operation methods, or rely on the
  command-backed fallback when the isolated workspace has `node` available.
  The headless helper rejects absolute paths, `..` escapes, and absolute glob
  patterns before dispatching file operations.

(An *operational* mode — intentionally running a trusted agent that *may* touch
the host — can slot into this same entry later. That is a different, explicit
trust posture, never the eval default.)

Programmatic sketch:

```ts
import {
  buildIsolatedHeadlessToolAvailability,
  buildIsolatedHeadlessTools,
  runExperiment,
  type IsolatedToolExecutor,
} from '@maka/headless';

const executor: IsolatedToolExecutor = {
  async exec(input) {
    // Route to Harbor/Docker/etc. Do not inherit host env/secrets.
    return { exitCode: 0, stdout: '', stderr: '' };
  },
  async readFile(input) {
    // Optional: implement native external workspace file reads instead of the
    // command-backed fallback.
    return { content: '' };
  },
};

await runExperiment(config, task, {
  storageRoot: '/tmp/maka-headless-runs',
  realBackendIsolation: {
    kind: 'external',
    label: 'Harbor task container',
    toolExecutor: executor,
  },
  registerBackends(registry, context) {
    registry.register('ai-sdk', (ctx) => createAiSdkBackend({
      ...ctx,
      tools: [...(ctx.tools ?? buildIsolatedHeadlessTools(context.toolExecutor!))],
      toolAvailability: buildIsolatedHeadlessToolAvailability(),
    }));
  },
});
```

## Spec

A spec is `configs × tasks`. Task `workspaceDir` paths resolve relative to the
spec file, so a spec travels with its fixtures.

```jsonc
{
  "configs": [
    { "id": "fake", "backend": "fake", "llmConnectionSlug": "fake", "model": "fake-model" }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "fix-bug", "instruction": "Make the failing test pass.",
      "workspaceDir": "./fixtures/fix-bug",
      "verification": {
        "command": "npm test",
        "timeoutMs": 120000,
        // REQUIRED grading boundary (see Grading). Use [] when the
        // verification reads nothing the agent could forge.
        "protectedPaths": ["test/"]
      } }
  ]
}
```

## Grading

Verification runs the task's `command` in the workspace; exit code 0 = pass.
A config must not be able to grade itself, so `verification.protectedPaths` is
**required**: list the test/grading files and they are restored from the
pristine fixture *after* the agent finishes and *before* the command runs — a
model that rewrote its own test to pass has that edit reverted. Declare `[]`
only when the verification reads nothing the agent can forge — as the bundled
`examples/demo` does, checking a fixture file the agent has no reason to touch.

Tasks may also use typed benchmark verifiers. Terminal-Bench is the first
carrier, but it is an adapter hook rather than a runtime architecture:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "terminal-bench-local",
  "instruction": "Solve the task.",
  "workspaceDir": "./fixtures/tb-task",
  "verifier": {
    "kind": "terminal_bench",
    "adapter": "terminal-bench",
    "instanceId": "local-task",
    "datasetPath": "./terminal-bench",
    "testCommand": "./run-tests.sh",
    "protectedPaths": ["tests/", "run-tests.sh"]
  }
}
```

`testCommand` mode runs in Maka's disposable scoring workspace and needs no
Docker, Harbor, or `tb` binary; because it is still a local command verifier,
`protectedPaths` is required. Real Terminal-Bench harness execution is wired
programmatically through `benchmarkAdapters` and an explicit external isolation
record.

`maka eval task-run run` writes append-only task-run JSONL under `<out>/runs/task-runs/`,
updates compatibility `results.jsonl`, and writes a canonical export under
`<out>/exports/<taskRunId>/`. Exports are projection-based: they include
trajectory/runtime refs, submitted snapshot metadata, verifier output, score,
budget, isolation, permission/inbox facts, taxonomy, and warnings. They do not
embed environment variables, credentials, or hidden harness configuration.

## Exit code

`maka eval run` exits non-zero on an **infrastructure** failure (invalid
spec, refused backend, a run that crashed before producing a result). A run
that completed and merely **failed its verification** is valid benchmark data
and exits 0.

## Legacy compatibility

`maka-headless` remains a deprecated compatibility binary and prints a warning;
new documentation and automation must use `maka eval`.
