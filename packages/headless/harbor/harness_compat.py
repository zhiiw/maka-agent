"""Select the benchmark harness package tree (plain Harbor vs Pier) at import time.

Terminal-Bench runs the adapters under plain Harbor 0.13.2, where only the
``harbor.*`` tree exists. DeepSWE runs them under Pier 0.3.0 (Datacurve's Harbor
fork), which ships a parallel ``pier.*`` tree plus a backward-compat ``harbor.*``
tree. The trees are type-incompatible: Pier's ``TrialResult.agent_info`` only
validates against ``pier.models.trial.result.AgentInfo``, so an adapter built on
the compat ``harbor.*`` tree fails Pier trial setup with a pydantic
ValidationError before any container or model work.

Selection rule: prefer Pier whenever ``import pier`` succeeds. The plain-Harbor
uv tool venv ships no pier distribution and always selects the harbor tree;
Pier's venv imports pier and selects the pier tree, where the compat
``harbor.*`` tree is never the right choice. The probe falls back to harbor
only when the ``pier`` package itself is absent (ModuleNotFoundError naming
``pier``); any other failure inside pier's own import — a broken install, a
missing dependency — re-raises at the probe, and a pier tree broken below the
top level fails when the first symbol resolves. Falling back in those cases
would silently rebuild the adapters on the compat harbor tree, which Pier's
``TrialResult`` rejects.

Symbols resolve lazily (PEP 562) so each adapter's transitive import surface
stays exactly the names it asks for; the harness-stub smoke tests in
``packages/headless/src/__tests__/harbor-adapter.test.ts`` rely on that to keep
stubbing only the modules each adapter actually uses.
