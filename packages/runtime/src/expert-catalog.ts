/**
 * Expert teams — data-driven lead/member personas with bounded collaboration.
 *
 * An expert team is a lead persona (runs as the main session) plus a set of
 * member "experts" the lead dispatches as read/tool-scoped child agents. This
 * keeps the lead responsible for fan-out, final synthesis, and task completion.
 * Members may exchange bounded, durable messages and atomically self-claim one
 * eligible shared task, but they cannot widen their capabilities or complete
 * shared work without lead review.
 *
 * Experts do not invent new tool scopes. Every expert declares a capability
 * `archetype` — one of the built-in {@link AgentProfile}s — and inherits that
 * archetype's tool set, permission mode, category policy, and workspace
 * contract. An expert may narrow (never widen) its tools to a subset of the
 * archetype's tools. This keeps the permission-safety invariant: a member can
 * never exceed the policy of the archetype it runs under.
 *
 * Member definitions are materialized into ordinary {@link AgentDefinition}s
 * with a deterministic id (`expert:<teamId>:<memberId>`) so the existing child
 * agent machinery (tool scoping, permission gating, worktree fail-closed) runs
 * them unchanged, and so a spawn can be resolved statelessly from the id alone.
