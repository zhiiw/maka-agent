// packages/runtime/src/bash-tail-buffer.ts
//
// Memory-bounded tail accumulator for streaming shell output. A runaway command
// must not be able to grow the captured result without limit (the old Bash path
// instead discarded ALL output past a hard cap), so we retain only the last
// `cap` characters.
//
// SECURITY: the retained tail is later passed through redactSecrets before it
// reaches the model / UI. redactSecrets matches on full tokens and their
// prefixes (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer …`, `sk-…`), so a tail that begins in
// the MIDDLE of a secret-bearing line would defeat redaction and leak the
// suffix. To prevent that, when the buffer actually drops content it also drops
// the (partial) leading line, so the retained tail always starts at a line
// boundary and redaction sees whole lines.
