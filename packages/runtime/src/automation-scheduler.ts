/**
 * Automation scheduler — manages a tick loop that fires active automations.
 *
 * Fixes applied from adversarial review:
 * - canFire errors are caught per-automation (don't abort the whole tick)
 * - injectTurn/createFreshRun failures properly mark the automation as failed
 * - A busy session defers the fire inside a ~45min retry window (equivalent to
 *   the old wakeup-scheduler's 5s→5min exponential backoff budget); only when
 *   the window is exhausted does skipFire() advance/settle the schedule
 * - Defer bookkeeping is pruned when automations disappear
 * - dispose() sets flag checked in async paths to prevent post-dispose execution
 * - Uses deps.now() consistently (injectable for testing)

 * fire after long-running work — agent turns routinely run for many minutes,
 * so a ~120s retry budget silently dropped (and for `once` terminally expired)
 * any fire that landed mid-turn. The old wakeup-scheduler retried with
 * exponential backoff, 5s doubling to a 5min cap (BACKOFF_BASE_MS →
 * BACKOFF_MAX_MS), waiting ~45 minutes in total before giving up. This
 * scheduler is tick-driven (a fixed 5s cadence), so the equivalent retry
 * budget is expressed as a wall-clock window: keep deferring for
 * DEFER_WINDOW_MS from the first deferred attempt, and only then skip the
 * fire (skipFire advances a recurring schedule; a `once` automation expires
 * ONLY when this window is exhausted — never on a transient busy blip).
