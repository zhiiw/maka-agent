// packages/runtime/src/tool-output.ts
//
// Shared, model-facing truncation for tool output (Bash stdout/stderr today).
//
// WHY: an unbounded tool result either floods the model's context (a chatty
// command's full output) or, worse, gets discarded outright when a hard byte
// cap is hit (the old Bash behavior threw away *all* output past 10MB, failing
// otherwise-finished work). Both hurt pass@1. This bounds what the model sees
// to a line/byte budget, keeps the most useful slice, and tells the model the
// output was cut and how to recover the rest.
//
// We deliberately do NOT spill the full output to a host-side file the way
// opencode does: the benchmark Bash path runs through an isolated executor that
// abstracts the filesystem away, so there is no shared location the host can
// write and the model can later read. Instead the truncation marker points the
// model at the portable recovery it can perform itself — re-run the command
// (only when it is safe to repeat) redirecting to a file, then Read/Grep that
// file; otherwise work from the kept window.
//
// Adapted from opencode's truncate.output() (packages/opencode/src/tool/
// truncate.ts): same byte+line budget and head/tail windowing, minus the file
// spill + retention machinery.
