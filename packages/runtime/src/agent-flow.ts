/**
 * AgentFlow — the runtime v2 model/tool loop seam.
 *
 * Architecture: docs/architecture/runtime-core-architecture-draft.md
 *
 * Layering (from the architecture doc):
 *
 *   RuntimeRunner
 *     -> InvocationContext  ← canonical spine from ./invocation-context.ts
 *     -> AgentFlow          ← this module defines the flow interface
 *         -> AiSdkFlow      ← default long-term implementation (./ai-sdk-flow.ts)
 *             -> AI SDK streamText
 *             -> ToolRuntime
 *     -> RuntimeEvent ledger
 *     -> projections
 *
 * A Flow owns the model/tool loop for one invocation. It consumes the
 * canonical InvocationContext + a FlowInput (the user turn) and emits the
 * canonical `RuntimeEvent` stream. The current stepping engine lives inside
 * `AiSdkBackend.send()`; `AiSdkFlow` wraps that backend and normalizes its
 * renderer-facing `SessionEvent` stream into canonical `RuntimeEvent`s
 * without rewriting the stepping logic. That keeps the AI SDK as Maka's
 * first-class long-term flow engine (Phase 4 design intent).
 *
 * Phase 4 scope (this node): interface + adapter/wrapper + mapping helpers
 * + tests. It does NOT migrate SessionManager onto the runner, does NOT
 * rewrite `AiSdkBackend.send()`, and does NOT change current renderer
 * behavior. The seam exists so future work can move from
 * `SessionManager -> AgentRun -> AiSdkBackend` to
 * `RuntimeRunner -> AiSdkFlow` without a flag day.

 *   - building provider messages from the input/history,
 *   - driving the model/tool stepping engine,
 *   - delegating tool execution to `ToolRuntime`,
 *   - mapping every model/tool/permission/usage/error/finish fact to a
 *     `RuntimeEvent`.
 *
 * A flow MUST emit exactly one terminal event (`isTerminalRuntimeEvent`)
 * per invocation, whether the turn completed, errored, aborted, or was
 * cancelled. Non-terminal partial chunks carry `partial: true`.
 *
 * Control surface (`stop` / `respondToPermission` / `dispose`) is optional
 * on the interface because not every flow implementation owns a steppable
 * engine. `AiSdkFlow` exposes these and delegates them to the wrapped
 * backend so the current control semantics are preserved.
